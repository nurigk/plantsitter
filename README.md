# Plantsitter

I love plants and I want to keep them alive! :green_heart:

This was my 2 day MVP project that I created shortly after my cactus passed away. I was too busy and forgot to water my cactus for a long time. It inspired me to create this app where users can sign up and get text message reminders to water their plants at the frequency of their choosing.

I'll never forget to water my plants again!

(BTW, right now, it can only send texts to my number as I'm using a free account. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

## Technology used
